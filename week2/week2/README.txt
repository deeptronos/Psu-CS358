The practice exercises for this week are in three parts:

1. exercises2a.py: Defining and working with abstract syntax trees for boolean expression.
As in week 1, your task it to complete missing function definitions in the file.
Some of the exercises are marked as optional challenge problems, meaning that you will
get full credit for a "good faith effort" even if you do not attempt them.

2. exercises2b.py: More of the same, but for a larger language of expressions
that includes let bindings. (These exercises are in a separate file to avoid naming
conflicts between the two versions of expressions.)  

3. Conditionals Mystery Language. Similar to the mystery language exercise in class,
but addressing a different feature.  Your task is to determine the behavior of
each of the language variants by running experiments using the web interface at

https://andrewtolmach.github.io/mysteries/cond/

Detailed instructions are in the file conditional_mystery.txt

Your analysis of the languages should be submitted in a file called conditionals_solution.txt

In summary, your solutions for this week should consist of three files:

exercises2a.py
exercises2b.py
conditionals_solution.txt

To submit, place these files in a single directory called week2,
zip them together to produce a single file week2.zip, and upload
this file to Canvas.

Please make sure that you zip the files
in context of the directory, not just the individual files,
so that when unzipped a new directory is created. 
For example, the following command should do the trick
when run from the directory *above* week2:

zip week2.zip week2/exercises2a.py  week2/exercises2b.py  week2/conditionals_solution.txt
