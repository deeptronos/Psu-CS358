Week 6 Practice Exercises

The practice exercises for this week are in two parts:

Problems 1 and 2: Extensions to the function language implementation.
See the file interp_problems.txt for instructions, which
tell you to put your solution in files parse_run_fun1.py,
expr_fun1.lark, and interp_fun1.py.

Problems 3, 4: and 5 Short-answer questions. See the file other_problems.pdf
for instructions, which tell you to put your solution in file other_solutions.txt.

In summary, your solutions for this week should consist of 4 files:

parse_run_fun1.py
expr_fun1.lark
interp_fun1.py
other_solutions.txt

To submit, place these files in a single directory called week6,
zip them together to produce a single file week6.zip, and upload
this file to Canvas.

Please make sure that you zip the files
in context of the directory, not just the individual files,
so that when unzipped a new directory is created. 
For example, the following unix command should do the trick
when run from the directory *above* week6:

zip week6.zip week6/{parse_fun_fun1.py,expr_fun1.lark,interp_fun1.py,other_solutions.txt}
