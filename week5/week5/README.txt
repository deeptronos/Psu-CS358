Week 5 Practice Exercises

The practice exercises for this week are in four parts:

Problem 1:  Boolean expressions grammar. See the file parse_bool.py for instructions, which
tell you to put your solution in a file parse_bool1.py

Problem 2:  Arithmetic expressions with exponentiation.  See the file parse_run_arith1.py
for instructions, which will tell you to put your solutions in files parse_run_arith2.py,
expr2.lark, and interp_arith2.py. 

Problems 3,4: Short Analysis Exercises. Follow the instructions in analysis_exercises5.pdf,
which tell you to put your solutions in a file analysis_solutions.txt. 

Functions Mystery Language.  Similar to the previous mystery language exercises,
but addressing a different feature.  Your task is to determine the behavior of
each of the language variants by running experiments using the web interface at

https://andrewtolmach.github.io/mysteries/func/

Detailed instructions are in the file functions_mystery.txt

Your analysis of the languages should be submitted in a file called functions_solution.txt

In summary, your solutions for this week should consist of 6 files:

parse_bool1.py
parse_run_arith2.py
expr2.lark
interp_arith2.py
analysis_solutions.txt
functions_solution.txt

To submit, place these files in a single directory called week5,
zip them together to produce a single file week5.zip, and upload
this file to Canvas.

Please make sure that you zip the files
in context of the directory, not just the individual files,
so that when unzipped a new directory is created. 
For example, the following unix command should do the trick
when run from the directory *above* week5:

zip week5.zip week5/{parse_bool1.py,parse_run_arith.py,expr2.lark,interp_arith2.py,analysis_solutions.txt,functions_solution.txt}
