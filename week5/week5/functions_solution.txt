While I feel confused about how to complete the exercise's required steps, I feel like I may understand how the interpreters work behind-the-scenes. 

Variant A is suited to dynamic environments where type safety isn't crucial but variable scoping is non-strict.

Variants B and C are suited to scenarios requireing lexical scoping but with either no typing or no runtime checks.

Variant D is suited to projects needing type enforcement for lexically scoped variables.
